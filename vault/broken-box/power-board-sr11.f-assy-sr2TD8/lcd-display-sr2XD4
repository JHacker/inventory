    PSP LCD display from SR2011 power board assembly
    Power board assembly put in "Broken" basket during SR2011. No indication of
    which part was broken, assume all broken.
    Update: rbarlow and jmorse recall this power board misbehaving seriously
    during the competition: it was displaying an all black output on the LCD
    when switched to the vision output. Switched out /only/ the power board
    assembly from the robot under test and it didn't happen again.
